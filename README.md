# Royal lineage problem
Calculates the most suitable heir in a royal family, based on the heritage of the candidates. The heritage is calculated by examining the heritage of the candidate's parents, whose heritage also is examined if necessary. This is repeated through a recursive function until either the king or an individual without royal blood is found.
